# Excursion

This repository contains the code for the Excursion web page project, created as part of the Codecademy "Learn Git and GitHub" course. In this project, I used HTML, CSS, Git, and GitHub to replicate the design and functionality of a landing page advertising a mobile app called Excursion.

The Excursion app helps users record and share their experiences, and the landing page features eye-catching visuals, including video and landscape imagery, to draw users in. The goal was to create a visually appealing and engaging product page while reinforcing skills with Git for version control and collaboration.

## Key Technologies
- HTML: For building the structure of the web page.
- CSS: For styling the page and making it responsive.
- Git & GitHub: For version control and collaboration on the project.
- BASH CLI: For interacting with Git locally.
- Markdown: For creating this meaningful description.

This project serves as a great introduction to using Git and GitHub in real-world web development, as well as working with HTML and CSS to build a professional-looking product page.
